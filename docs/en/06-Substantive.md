# Nouns

## § 21

Interlingue leaves words to their **natural endings**, and does not prescribe certain final vowels for certain classes of words.

_Cangurú, villa, radio, matre, midí._

## § 22

The **neutral final vowel -e** is found in many nouns to establish the correct pronounciation of the final consonant, for euphony, or to distinguish the noun from a similar adjectival or verbal form. 

_Pace, image, rose, libre, cable, altruisme, curve, centre, central, centrale, directiv, directive, marine, circulare, cantate, infinite, tangente._

## § 23

A **grammatical gender** does not exist. All nouns are masculin, feminine or neutral according to their meaning.

## § 24

One can indicate the gender in names for entities: **-o** indicates masculine, **-a** the feminine. 

_Anglese, angleso, anglesa, cavall, cavallo, cavalla._

Words such as patre, matre etc. do not require gender endings, because they are masculine or feminine on their own. 

In other nouns **-o** indicates one special, individual, singular, concrete, **-a** one general, extended, collective, common, as well as action, location and time. 

_rosiero, rosiera, lago, aqua, promenada, plazza, pasca._

## § 25

Some nouns form derivatives by adding **u** / **a** respectively at the root; they retain the **u** / **a** also in the non-derivative forms. 

_manu, manual, sexu, sexual, sexualitá, gradu, gradual, graduation, sistema, sistematic, sistematico, sistematisar, sistematisation, dogma, dogmatic, dogmatisme, drama, dramatic, dramaturgo, aqua, aquatic, clima, climatic, climatolog, climatologie, climatologic._

## § 26

To indicate the **plural** one adds **-s**, after consonants inserting a euphonic **-e-**, where it is possible without changing the pronunciation of the word. 

_un líbre, du libres, un angul, tri angules, li person, li persones, li tric, li trics, li plug, li plugs, li album, pluri albums, li tram, du trams._

## § 27

The noun remains unchanged in all **grammatical cases**. Only the genitive with the preposition **de**, and the dative with the preposition **a** are distinguished. 

_Yo vide li sapates de mi fratre.Yo dat li sapates a mi fratre._ (I see the boots of my brother. I gave the boots to my brother.)

## § 28

**Proper names** are changed as little as possible. For the main geographic names, the most international words are selected in Interlingue; otherwise one uses a writing as close to the original as possible. 

_Goethe, Shakespeare; Alpes, Danubio, Germania; London, Berlin, Milano, Moskwa, Kharkow, Hoang-ho._
