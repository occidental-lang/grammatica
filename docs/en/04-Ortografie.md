# ORTOGRAFIE

## § 10

Interlingue conserves as much as possible the **international appearance** of the words; but it is recommended to change **doubled consonantes** to a single, except if it is pronounced differently or is necessary to indicate that the preceding vowel is short or that the **s** is not sonorous. Doubled consonantes in the root remain also in the derived forms. 

_access, suggester, anates, annu, annales, asserfer, aromatic, bloc, arogant, can, canne, car, carre, present, pressent, li atacca, il atacca, ataccar, cellul, cellulose, rebell, rebellion._

## § 11

The **Greek consonant groops: th, chl, chr, ph** are in general simplified to: **t, cl, cr, f**, and instead of a vocalic **y** one writes i. The historic orthography is also permitted, however. 

_tema o thema, fonograf o phonograph, cloroform o chloroform, simpatic o sympatic o sympathic._

## § 12

**Syllabic separation** is free; preferable is the separation used in speech or according to the word components.

## § 13

**Upper case** is used only in the beginning of sentences, in prober names, in titles, and for distinguishing Vu, Vos, Vor as polite forms from vu, vos, vor, if one wishes to make the distinction. 

_Paul, London, Pacifico, Anglia, Danubio, li Senior, su Majestie._
