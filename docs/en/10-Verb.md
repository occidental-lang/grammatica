# Verbs
 

## § 65

In Interlingue there is a single and unitary conjugation for adding certain consonants to the present tense.

## § 66

The **present tense** is formed by adding one of the three vowels (a, i, e) to the verbal tense (root plus prefixes and suffixes). This vowel is characteristic for each verb and remains unchanged in all forms of conjugation.

| Tema verbal | Tema presentic |
| --- | --- |
| fabric |  fabrica |
| exped | expedi  |
| construct | constructe  |

This characteristic vowel appears in all forms of conjugation; one can therefore base all conjugation on the present tense, and make distinctions only by final consonants, identical for the three groups of verbs.

## § 67

The first, second and third person, singular and plural, are distinguished only by the pronoun; the verb itself remains unchanged.

## § 68

The **infinitive** is formed by adding -r to the present tense: 

```
fabricar
expedir
constructer
```

## § 69

The presente is equal to the present tense:

```
yo fabrica
tu expedi
il constructe
```

The verb **esser** has a special abbreviated form for the present: **es**, instead of esse, due to its large frequency.

## § 70

The **past participle** (also **passive participle**) is formed by adding **-t** to the present tense: 

```
fabricat
expedit
constructet
```

The past participle is also used as the **simple past**: 

```
noi fabricat
vu expedit
ili constructet
```

## § 71

All **composite past tense** is formed by the auxiliary verb **har**. It indicates actions that have terminated.

The **composite past** is: 

```
yo ha fabricat (I have made) 
tu ha expedit (you have sent) 
il ha constructet (he has constructed)
```

The **anterior past** is: 

```
noi hat fabricat (we had made) 
vu hat expedit (you had sent) 
ili hat constructet (they had constructed)
```
 
## § 72

The **simple future** is formed by the auxiliary **va**: 

```
il va fabricar (he will make) 
ella va expedir (she will send) 
on va constructer (one will construct)
```

The **anterior future** is: 

```
yo va har fabricat (I will have made) 
tu va har expedit (you will have sent) 
il va har constructet (he will have constructed)
```
 

## § 73

The **simple conditional** is formed by the auxiliary **vell**: 

```
noi vell laborar (we would work) 
vu vell expedir (you would send) 
ili vell constructer (they would construct)
```

The **past conditional** is: 

```
il vell har fabricat (he would have made) 
il vell har expedit (he would have sent) 
ili vell har constructet (they would have constructed)
```
 
## § 74

The **present participle** (also active participle) is formed by adding **-nt** to the present tense: 

```
fabricant
expedient
constructent
```

Verbs with -i take -ent instead of -nt to recover international forms, for example convenientie, provenientie.

The **adverbial form** is used as a gerund (= while or by that) by adding **-e**: 

```
fabricante
expediente
constructente
```

There are also **progressive forms**: 

```
il es fabricant (he is making) 
il es expedient (he is sending) 
il es constructent (he is constructing)
```
 
## § 75

The **imperative** is the same as the present without the pronoun: 

```
fabrica!
expedi!
constructe!
```

From the verb **esser** one takes the complete form: **esse**.

There is a **polite form with ples** (from pleser) with the infinitive: 

```
ples fabricar
ples expedir
ples constructer
```

## § 76

The **optative** is with **mey** with the infinitive: 

```
il mey fabricar (he may make) 
il mey expedir (he may send) 
il mey constructer (he may construct)
```

The **hortative** with **lass**: 

```
lass nos fabricar
lass nos expedir
lass nos constructer
```

## § 77

**Passive forms** are formed with the auxiliary verb **esser**: 

```
it es perlaborat (it is transformed) 
ili esset perlaborat (they were transformed*) 
it ha esset perlaborat (it has been transformed*)

ili hat esset expedit (they had been sent) 
it va esser expedit (it will be sent) 
ili va har esset expedit (they will have been sent)  

it vell esser constructet (it would be constructed) 
ili vell har esset constructet (they would have been constructed) 
it mey esser constructet (it may be constructed)
```

This manner of forming the passive is common to most national languages. But sometimes it is necessary to distinguish if an action is still going or is finished. In those cases one uses other verbs, for example: 

```
Li dom ea constructet. (The house is being constructed) 
Li dom sta constructet. (The house stands/is constructed) 
Li libre eat printat. (The book was being printed) 
Li libre stat printat. (The book was (stood) printed.)
```

In many cases the passive can be expressed by nouns or the reflexive form:

```
Li dom es in construction. (The house is in/under construction) 
Li libre esset in printation. (The book was being printed) 
Li jurnal printa se rapid. (The journal prints quickly*) 
Li cose explica se simplicmen. (The thing explains itself simply (It's self-explanatory))
```
 
## § 78

**In place of the subjuntive** one in general uses the indicative. Only in rare exceptional cases (ex. in legal documents) one can use a form of the subjunctive by adding **-ye** to the present of the verb or the auxiliary verb: 

_Il di que il la amaye. (He says that he would love* her) Il dit que il la haye amat. (He said that he would have* loved her)_

# Verbal derivation

## § 79

In all languages thousands of nouns and adjectives are formed from the verbal root by adding suffixes. Those words seem to be formed so irregularily that the most well-known international languages until now have renounced incorporating them in their system of derivation and have exchanged them with artificial constructions. 

The creator of Interlingue, **Prof. Edgar de Wahl**, has discovered how simple rules are for forming the known international words by adding international endings to international roots.

 

## § 80

The suffixes: **ion, or, ori, iv, ura** are not added to the verbal tense or the present tense, but to the perfect tense. 

That first group of endings are added to verbs expressing an action or transformation, to the so-called **dynamic verbs**.

The perfect tense is found by De Wahl's Rule, the key to the only language truly international and at the same time regular:

One suppresses the **r / er** of the infinitive. If the remainder finishes with a vowel, one adds a **t**, if it finishes with **d** or **r**, one replaces the consonant with s; in all other cases the remainder itself is the perfect tense.

| crear | expedir | distribuer | exploder | adherer | constructer |
| ----- | ------- | -----------| -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| crea  | expedi  | distribu   | explod   | adher   | construct   |
| creat  | expedit  | distribut   | explos   | adhes   | construct   |

One can also say that the suffixes: **ion, or, ori, iv and ura** are added to the verbs with ar and ir as passive participle, and to the verbs with er as the root, adding a **t** after the vowel ending and mutating a final **d** or **r** to **s**.

| crear | expedir | constructer |
| --- | ------| ------|
| creat | expedit | construct |
| creation | expedition | construction |
| creator | expeditor | constructor |
| creatori | expeditori | constructori |
| cretiv | expeditiv | constructiv |
| creatura | garnitura | structura |

| distribuer | exploder | adherer |
| --- | ------| ------|
| distribut | explos | adhes |
| distribution | explosion | adhesion |
| distributor | revisor | precursor |
| distributori | revisori | cursori |
| distributiv | explosiv | adhesiv |
| scritura | tonsura |   |

**Five verbs** form these derivatives a bit differently, using the international forms:  


```
seder  -> session (instead of: sesion)
ceder  -> cession (instead of: cesion)
verter -> version (instead of: vertion)
venir  -> vention (instead of: venition)
tener  -> tention (instead of: tenion)
```

## § 81

In the three verbs: **far, dir, scrir** one can form the derivitives by the complete roots: **fact, dict, script**. 

With the verbs with the consonant group** -nct-** one can omit the **c**, mostly in nonderived forms. 

_Contrafaction o contrafation, factor o fator, malediction o maledition, prescription o prescrition. Distincter o distinter, distinction o distintion, conjunction, conjunter._

## § 82

The **final -ntie** is added to the present theme of verbs expressing a state, to the so-called **static verbs**.

| tolerar | provenir | exister |
| --- | --- | --- |
| tolerantie | provenientie | existentie |

As in the present participle one adds **e** after **i** of verbs in **ir**. This final is only a combination of the final of the present participle **-nt** with the suffix **-ie**.

 

## § 83

In an analogous manner the suffix **-nd** is added to the present tense: 

```
demonstrand
vendiend
leend
```

## § 84

The suffix **-ment** is also added to the present tense: 

| fundar | experir | mover |
| --- | --- | --- |
| fundament | experiment | movement |

If the root of a verb with **er** finishes with a vowel, the **e** disappears: 

_arguer argument compleer complement_
 

## § 85

Two suffixes add themselves to the verbal root in two different forms according to the characteristic vowel: **-abil, -ada** to **a** and **-ibil**, **-ida** to **i** or **e**:

| durar | promenar | audir | vomir | posser | currer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| durabil | promenada | audibil | vomida | possibil | currida |

## § 86

The **other suffixes** are added directly to the verbal root:

| criticar | lavar | furter | spiar |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| criticachar | lavera | furtard | spion |

| valer | reservar | rafinar | viver |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| valore | reservuor | rafinage | vìvaci |

## § 87

**Direct noun creation**: One can also use the verbal root as a noun with the noun endings, or the perfect tense with or without noun ending: 

_li pense, li pensa (closer to the action), li vende, li crede, li response, li vise, li flut, lì resultat, li extracte, li tribut._ 

The perfect tense without final is also used as an **adjective**: 

_devot, apert, pervers._
