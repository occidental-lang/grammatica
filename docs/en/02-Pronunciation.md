# PRONUNCIATION

## § 3

The vowels are always clearly pronounced as follows:

- **a** as in F (French), or G (German), or S (Spanish), or I (Italian), or E (English): father. vase, batte, batter.

- **e** open or closed, as GSI, E: bed, yes, F: é or è. pena, mensu, pelle, venir.

- **i** as FGSI, E: machine. nive, six, minute.

- **o** open or closed, as FGSI, A: door, hot. modic, póndere, porta, ponderar.

- **u** as GSI, A: rule, pull, F: ou; after q very short, almost consonantal (w). brun, mult, sudar, quar.

- **y** after a vowel, and in the beginning of a word or before a vowel is a consonant, otherwise a vowel.

- **y _vocalic_** es pronunciat quam Int (Interlingué) i. physica.

Of two or multiple **following vowels** each is pronounced. Unaccented **i** and **u** before vowels and in the combinations **au** and **eu** (**u**likewise **a** and **e** are short) is very short, almost like a consonant, and cannot form proper syllables.

_leôn *, creatôr, mêdie, mediôcri, mêdium, lìngue, linguâl, lìnguìstic, trottuôre, càude, neutrâl, arcâic, vîa, revûe._

?> Illustrative signs, not to be written: ê: long, è: short.

Also, a strict rule on the long or short, closed or open pronounciation of the vowels does not exist. Pronounciations similar to FGSI are preferable.

One who does not know some of these pronunciations can follow the indications in [§ 4](02-Pronunciation?id=§-4) as a recommendation, but not as a strict or complete rule.

## § 4

In general **accented vowels** are fairly **long**; but in front of a final **c**, **ch**, **x**, or in front of several consonants (excepting **r** or **l** with a preceding different consonant), and in the small grammatical words, are **short**. **Unaccented vowels** are more or less **short**.

**A, i, u** always have a medial sonality quite distinct from other vowels. **Accented e** and **o** are **closed**, if they are long, and before **m** and **n**, **open** in all other cases. Unaccented **e** and **o** are more or less **closed**.

_marchâr*, vidêr, venîr, sonôri, constructôr, constructiôn, chèc, iràc, depèche, paradòx, pâtre, splìttre, câble, pèlle, dilëmma, cömma, mënte, mönte, atàcca, fòsse, transpòrt, idê, burô, cön, ë, li, më._

?> Illustrative signs, not to be written: ê: long and closed, ë: short and closed, è: short and open.

## § 5

**The consonants** are pronounced as follows:

**b, d, f, I, m, n, p** as in EFGI, S (b = b in boca). _bon, editer, fratre, long, matre, null, pede._

Of **doubled consonants** the second is pronounced only if it is pronounced differently from the first. _acceptar, suggester._

**c** before e, i, y = ts, otherwise as k. _centre, reciver, cilindre, concert, acceptar, electric, electricitá._

**ch** F, E: sh, G: sch, also permitted E: ch, S: ch, but not recommended; before consonants as k. _machine, marchar, chec; chloroform._

**g** before e, i, y: EFI, G: soft sch as in generös, otherwise EFGSI (gn as much as possible g-n, not nye). _gage, gigant, garage, gimnastica, guvernar, grisi, suggestion, magnific._ 

**gh** in some rare words before e, i, y as g before a. _ghetto._

**h** always aspirated as EG. _hom, adherer._

**j** as F, E: _vision_, G: soft sch as _Journal_, thus as Int g before e. _jurnalist, manjar, jokey._

**k** and **kh** as hard c. _kilogramm, Khedive._ 

**ph** as f (in Greek words). _telephon._

**qu** as k, always followed by a very short u: EGI, F and S with u. _quar, aqua._

**r** FGSI. _radie, merce._ 

**rh** as r (in Greek words). _rheumatisme._

**s** sonorous between vowels, hard in all other cases. _cose, position, pos, es, roses, altesse, divers, sospirar, posta._  

**ss** as hard s. _casse._ 

**sh, sch** as E: sh, F: ch, G: sch (exists only in some words to conserve the natural aspect). _shrapnell, schema._

**t** is sibilant (as ts) before ia, ie, io, iu, if there is no preceding s, otherwise EFGSI. _tolerantie, tentar, tentation, hostie._ 

**th** as t (in Greek words). _theosoph, lithograph._

**v** as EFSI, G: _venir, dever, nive._ 

**w** is rare, as E, short Int: u. _west._ 

**x** hard or soft, as EFG, S: _examinar. examinar, extra._ 

**y** consonantal as E, F: _yeux_, G: j, S: _ayustar. yes, rayon, antey._ 

**z** soft (ds), if possible, otherwise hard (ts). _zefir._ 

**zz** hard (ts). _plazza._

## § 6

Experience proves that **small variations** in in pronunciation do not encumber comprehension. Because of this it **is permitted** to pronounce the vocalic y as F: u, G: ù, qu as kw, ch as tsch, j always g followed by e, i, y as dj. 

_cylindre, quadre, marchar, chef, jurnal, gengive._

Those with difficulty in the pronunciation of certain combinations of final consonent with the initial consonants of the following word can insert a **semimute E**, but without writing it.

## § 7

**Foreign words** are pronounced as close as possible as in the language of origin.

_Champagne, cognac._
