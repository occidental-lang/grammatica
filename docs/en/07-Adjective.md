# Adjectives

## §29

The characteristic vowel final **-i** is found in many adjectives, mainly to fix the correct pronunciation of the final consonant, and for distinction after typical noun and infinitive endings.  

_felici, sagi, porosi, organisatori, amari._

## § 30

Many adjectives can easily become **nouns** through addition of the endings **-e, -o, -a**. 

_yun, yune, yunes, yunos, yunas._

## §31

To form a noun expressing the **general idea** of a quality one adds the ending **-um**. 

_li novum, li bellum._

## § 32

Adjectives are **invariable** in gender and number. 

_li grand filio, li grand filia, li grand filios, li grand filias._

## § 33

When the adjective is used without a noun and one needs for certain reasons to indicate the **plural**, one adds an **-s**, after consonants adding a euphonic **-i-**, where that is possible without changing the pronunciation. 

_Vi pomes, prende li maturis._ 
(Here are apples, take the ripe ones)

## § 34

For the **comparative** one indicates 

**equality** with **tam - quam** 
a **greater** amount with **plu - quam** 
a **lesser** amount with **minu (min) - quam** 

_Il es **tam** grand **quam** su fratre; il es **plu** grand **quam** su fratre; il es **minu** grand **quam** su fratre. Il es **plu** grand **quam** yo. Li plu grand libre._
(He is as large as his brother; he is larger than his brother; he is less large than his brother. He is larger than me. The largest book.)

## § 35

For the **superlative** one indicates 

the **greatest** amount with **maxim** (max) 
the **least** amount with **minim**. 

_Li maxim grand del libres. Li minim grand libre._
The largest of the books. The least large book.

## § 36

For the **absolut superlative** one uses: **tre**, or the suffix: **-issim**. 

_tre grand, grandissim._

To compare three or more grades one uses: 

_grand, plu grand, mem plu grand, plu grand ancor, mem plu grand ancor._ 
(large, larger, even larger, still larger, even larger still)

## § 37

In all comparisons one uses: **quam**.  

_egalmen quam, altrimen quam._
